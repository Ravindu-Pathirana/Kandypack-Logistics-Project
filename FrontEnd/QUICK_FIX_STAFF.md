## 📊 What Data is Saved

When you add a staff member, this is stored:

```json
{
  "employee_id": 3,           ← Auto-generated
  "employee_name": "Your Name",
  "role": "Driver",
  "official_contact_number": "+94771234567",
  "current_route": "R-01",
  "status": "On Duty",        ← Default
  "weeklyHours": 0,           ← Starts at 0
  "maxWeeklyHours": 40,       ← Driver limit
  "experience": "New",        ← New hire
  "rating": 0,                ← No rating yet
  "completed_deliveries": 0   ← No deliveries yet
}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Data is local** - Stored in your browser only
2. **Per browser** - Chrome ≠ Firefox
3. **Per domain** - localhost:8080 ≠ localhost:3000
4. **Clearing cache** - Will reset to defaults
5. **Production** - Should connect to real database
