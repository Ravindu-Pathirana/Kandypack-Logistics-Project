### Before (Not Working)
```
[View Schedule]  [Assign Route]
    ↓                 ↓
  Nothing          Nothing
```

### After (Working!)
```
[View Schedule]          [Assign Route]
    ↓                         ↓
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐

## 💾 Data Persistence

When you assign a route:

```javascript
// Stored in localStorage
{
  "employee_id": 1,
  "employee_name": "Kamal Perera",
  "current_route": "R-02",  ← UPDATED!
  "status": "On Duty",      ← AUTO-SET!
  ...
}
```

Survives:
- ✅ Page refresh (F5)
- ✅ Browser restart
- ✅ Navigation away and back
- ✅ Closing tab

---

## 🎯 What Each Button Does

### View Schedule Button
- Opens modal for that specific driver
- Shows their work history
- Displays upcoming trips
- Shows weekly stats

### Assign Route Button
- Opens modal for that specific driver
- Shows current route assignment
- Lets you pick new route
- Updates immediately
- Sets status to "On Duty"

---

## ✅ Quick Verification

```javascript
// Check in DevTools Console (F12)

// 1. See all drivers
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('kandypack_drivers'))

// 2. Check specific driver's route
const drivers = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('kandypack_drivers'));
const driver = drivers.find(d => d.employee_id === 1);
console.log(`Driver: ${driver.employee_name}`);
console.log(`Route: ${driver.current_route}`);
console.log(`Status: ${driver.status}`);
```
